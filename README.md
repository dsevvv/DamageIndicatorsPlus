# Overview

Are you looking for something a little bit extra to make your SMP feel unique? DamageIndicatorsPlus adds very cool holograms that display the amount of damage done to players and other entities. As well as displaying the amount of health a player is healing! Many configurable options!

There are currently few commands and permissions associated with this plugin. However, functionality comes out of the box,so you can simply drop this into your plugins folder and you're good to go!

RECCOMENDED: I highly recommend using [Paper](https://papermc.io/). This is optional, but if you use Paper it will GREATLY improve the feel and performance of your server.
