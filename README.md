# DamageIndicatorsPlus
Premium Damage Indicators Plugin


![Game Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXFuBi2UGaQ)

Are you looking for something a little bit extra to make your SMP feel unique? DamageIndicatorsPlus adds very cool holograms that display the amount of damage done to players and other entities. As well as displaying the amount of health a player is healing! Many configurable options!

There are currently NO COMMANDS OR PERMISSIONS associated with this plugin, you can simply drop this into your plugins folder and you're good to go!

RECCOMENDED: I highly recommend using Paper and ProtocolLib. These are both optional dependencies, but if you have them both it will GREATLY improve the feel and performance of the plugin.
